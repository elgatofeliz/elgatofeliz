Hi, I'm bj√∏rn and I'm a Web Developer.
Currently studying at SuperCode learning HTML ,CSS, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, MongoDB 
and several other technologies related to Front- and Backend Web Development.

I'll start Freelancing in March 2022, building pages from design templates. I'm open to any new impulses if
it resonates.

Have a look at my repos and feel free to contact me :)
